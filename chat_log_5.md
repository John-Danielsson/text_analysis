**You:** Who is the author of the article?

**Chatbot:** The author of the article is Zoltan Pozsar, who draws on the experiences of macro investors such as George Soros, Stanley Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones, Louis Bacon, and John Maynard Keynes.

**You:** Who does Pozsar work for?

**Chatbot:** Pozsar does not work for any particular organization. He is an independent analyst and commentator on global economic and financial markets, and his work is distributed in the U.S. by Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (“CSSU”), a member of NYSE, FINRA, SIPC and the NFA. In Japan, his work is distributed by Credit Suisse Securities (Japan) Limited, Financial Instruments.

**You:** What does Zoltan say about portfolio balance?

**Chatbot:** Zoltan does not directly address portfolio balance in this context. However, he does emphasize the need for investors to be mindful of the risks associated with their portfolios and to consider rebalancing their portfolios to account for these risks. He also discusses the risks associated with the market's inflation view and the risks associated with the market's growth views, as well as the risks of the Fed hiking to 5% or 6% and the risks of rates cresting there despite economic and asset price pain. He suggests that the Fed may keep interest rates high for a while to ensure that rate cuts won't cause an economic rebound. This suggests that investors should take into account the different laws and regulations in their home jurisdiction when considering portfolio balance, as well as the potential risks associated with the market's inflation and growth views.

**You:** How does he suggest rebalancing portfolios?

**Chatbot:** The author suggests rebalancing portfolios by focusing on the services economy and labor market, which still remain strong. He suggests reducing demand for labor in the service sector, which is a function of the level of wealth across a range of assets (housing, stocks, as well as crypto). He also suggests curbing the "Super Size Me" mentality and replacing it with Jimmy Carter's theme of living thriftily (a "cultural revolution"). He suggests that the Fed should focus on curbing inflation, even at the cost of a "depression" and not getting reappointed. He suggests that the West should develop its own supply of things such that "L" becomes "L/", and that the recovery should be driven by fiscally funded industrial policy. He also suggests that clients should contact sales coverage and execute transactions through a Credit Suisse subsidiary or affiliate in their home jurisdiction unless governing law permits otherwise, and that Credit Suisse Asset Management LLC (CSAM) should be authorised by the Securities and Exchange Commission under US laws.

**You:** What split does he suggest for investing?

**Chatbot:** The author does not suggest a specific split for investing. He is discussing the risks associated with the Federal Reserve's current approach to inflation and the potential for a recession. He suggests that the market may be expecting too much from the Fed in terms of rate cuts and that the Fed may be more focused on curbing inflation than on stimulating growth. He also suggests that the Fed may be more likely to keep interest rates high for a while to ensure that rate cuts don't cause an economic rebound. He does not suggest a specific split for investing, but does advise investors to be aware of the potential risks associated with the current economic environment and to consider diversifying their investments across different asset classes.
