 credit suisse economics war and interest rates war is inflationary wars come in many different shapes and forms there are hot wars cold wars  and what pippa malmgren calls hot wars in cold places cyberspace space  and deep underwater see here  we would also add to the list of cold places washington  beijing  and moscow  where great powers are waging hot war s involving the flow of technologies  goods  and commodities hot economic wars which have been major contributors to inflation rece ntly inflation did not start with the hot war in ukraine the war did fan the inflationary currents that ha d been under way already  u nderstanding inflation as the result of a n escalating economic war and a lingering pandemic is important for if war and zero  covid policies stay  the view that inflation is mostly cyclical driven by excessive stimulus  is wrong  after visiting over 150 clients in eight european capitals over six weeks my impression is that the expected path of w estern policy rates rests on two hopes first that inflation is about to peak s econd that we are near peak hawkishness obviously if the first view is right the second view is right too but the risk with the first view is that it assumes a stab le world with no geopolitical risk premia where demand management is more powerful than issues related to supply  when in fact we live in an unstable world where geopolitical risk premia are rising and where supply  side issues are more powerful than demand management it follows that if the first view is wrong inflation is driven by the economic war not stimulus the second view is wrong too we are not at peak hawkishness  the aim of dispatch is to hig hlight risks to the peak hawkishness view thus with slight exaggeration t he low inflation worl d stood on three pillars first cheap immigrant labor keeping service sector wa ges stagnant in the us  second cheap goods from china raising living standards amid stagnant wages  third cheap russian gas powering german industry and the eu more broadly  us consumer s w ere soaking up all the cheap stuff the world had to offer  the asset rich benefit ing from decades of qe  bought high  end stuff from europe produced using cheap russian gas  and lower  income households bought all the cheap stuff coming from china all this has worked for decades  until n a tivism  protectionism  and geopolitics destabilized the low inflation world  1 august 2022 investment solutions  sustainability global important information this is not research please refer to the important disclosures and contact your credit suisse representative for more details this report represents the views of the investment strategy department of credit suisse and has not been prepared in accordance with the legal requirements designed to promote the independence of investment research it is not a product of the credit suisse research department and the view of the investment strategy department may differ materially fro m the views of the credit suis se research department and other divisions at credit suisse even if it references published research recommendations credit suisse has a number of policies in place to promote the independence of credit suisse s research departments from credit suisse s investment strategy  and other departments and to manage conflicts of interest including policies relating to dealing ahead of the dissemination of investment research these policies do not apply to the views of investment strategists contained in this re port contributors zoltan pozsar 212 538 3779 zoltanpozsarcredit  suissecom

 1 august 2022 war and interest rates 4 the unfolding economic war between great powers is stochastic and not linear and what inflation will do in the future does not only depend on the shocks that occurred in the recent past but also on the many shocks that can happen still these include more sanctions and the further weaponization of commodities and more technology sanctions and further supply chain issues for cheap goods getting right where inflation goes from here is basically a matter of perspective do you see inflation as cyclical a messy re  opening after covid exacerbated by excessive stimulus  or structural a messy transition to a multipolar world order where two great p owers are challenging the might and hegemony of the us if the former inflation has peaked if the latter inflation has barely started and could actually be understood as an outright instrument of war  for as lenin said the best way to dest abilize the capitalist system is to debauch the currency  finally t wo more notes to close peter drucker delayed publishing his book the end of economic man the origins of totalitarianism  until 1939 because he was frightened to say that wwii was about to begin  i feel his angst as i write of my belief that we have already entered wwiii but before you jump out of your skin try to remember that war is changing the confrontations and conflicts of our time may be different from what we experienced before r exclusively about physical territory and humans on a front line but about cyberspace space and the high seas as well as pipelines interbank messaging systems swift  asml machines currencies  commodities  and inflation as described in our opening essay above  second an observation about macro investing amidst a raging economic war  m acro investing had its golden age in the post  cold war era and investors like george soros stanley druckenmiller  paul tudor jones  and louis bacon traded in a peac eful world punctuated only by relatively small military conflicts the big conflicts these investors traded were nominal  and involved markets and central banks and the first three of the four price s of money par interest  and foreign exchange see here and here  t  a complex economic war between  driv es t he fourth price of money the price level and its derivative inflation central banks fighting markets but are the inflationary consequences of the economic war  t he besieged prices are not par fx pegs  and bases between various rates but the price level of goods and services which is inflating faster than target john maynard keynes is one investor who comes to mind that we know practiced macro investing during the interwar period and another investor is nathan meyer rothschild who loaded up on g ilts when he learned before neither of these figures approached their investments using a bottom  up micro understanding o the economic consequences of the peace and victory respectively  to place wagers on interest rates today about the risk of inflation staying higher for longer due to economic war fare  and less about inflation being driven by a messy re  opening process and stimulus  w  the focus of t is inflation and the fed  in subsequent dispatches  talk about what it will take to fix the supply  side natural  side fixes and why central banks be able to get out of qe no qt  even as inflation is likely to remain high  
 1 august 2022 war and interest rates 5 thus l start with some observations about  combined with an extremely tight labor market in the service sector in the us and the developed west more generally  the tightness of the labor market is the result of protectionist immigration policies in the us or brexit in the uk and early retirements and much less global labor mobility due to the pandemic  and the food and energy prices is the result of the war in ukraine after decades of neglect food and energy only on core inflation food and energy prices basic everyday necessities are especially dangerous in a structurally tight labor market  as w orkers demand higher wages not when discretionary items like tv screens and cars cost more but when necessities cost more w ages are under pressure already  globally  because of cost  of  living issues government workers in australia recently g ot a 5 increase in their salaries which will set the tone for wage adjustments in its private sector oil rig workers in norway went on a strike recently after they were offered a 5 increase in wages but wanted 10 at the port of la longshoremen secured a 10 increase in wages and also a clause that limits automation at the port and by extension the substitution of labor with machines finally in the us and in germany pilots that retired early during the pandemic are being offered 50 over the salary of active pilots if they come back to fly to ease the shortage of pilots during the summer all these examples involve wage increases that are at least in  line with the 5 growth of wages in the us or multiples of that double or ten times as fast wage pressures are an issue  three years of above  target inflation are starting to affect wage  price dynamics  comments from corporate ceos during the second quarter earnings season also suggest that pri ce pressures will continue for the for eseeable future  globally  and that means that other than food energy  and core services inflation driven by wages  see above  core goods inflation will remain a problem too  driven mostly by supply chain issues due to zero  covid polic ies  we have purposefully omitted the contribution of stimulus measures from our discussion while g enerous stimulus checks in the us have no doubt contributed to elevated rates of inflation inflation is elevated everywhere including in countries where stimulus was less generous  i nflation today is simply everywhere it possible to talk to anyone who doesn t complain about rising prices  or to r ead the financial press without articles about inflation  i t is also impossible to have a client meeting where inflation is not the center of discussion as james aitken recently noted inflation expectations are well anchored when nobody talks about inflation  and by that measure inflation expectations are bec oming clearly unanchored as a relatively junior member of the credit suisse economics team explained to me the experience with forecasting inflation in the post  pandemic period has be e n humbling forecasts have been way off including the fed  now if an economist straight out of university gets that in a stochastic world where the price of everything is thrown around randomly by a pandemic and a n unrestricted economic war inflation is impossible to forecast why is the market so confident that inflation is about to peak because the fed says so  beware if yes for recent forecasting record has been very poor  and so if the market discounts the forecasts  you could be in for a surprise as to whe n data dependent not forecast dependent and the do

 1 august 2022 war and interest rates 8 theme of living thriftily a cultural revolution  and that involves not only slowing the interest  rate sensitive parts of the economy housing and durables but also reducing demand for labor in the service sector which as we have argued here and here  is a function of the level of wealth across a range of assets housing stocks  as well as crypto m the system and what the fed is telling us when it flat  out dismiss es two quarters of negative gdp growth is that it i t focus ing as much on the rate  sensitive parts of the economy as it did in the past instead it is focus ing much more on the services economy and the labor market  which still remain strong and there in lies the cautionary tale for the inflation basically this is one reason why the market expects the fed to ease in a year time  t he other is the wishful thinking is that inflation has peaked we articulated the risks to the inflation view above  w e will now articulate the risks to the s  the fed has a dual mandate inflation and full employment now consider that inflation today is way above target and employment is way more than full there are more job openings than there are people to fill them and  employment is a part of the inflation problem fulfilling both of the mandates requires less growth not in measurable goods but in immeasurable se rvices  where we measure the health of the sector through wages and demand for labor  and t oday demand for services and demand for labor still remain way too strong  the ma r but as explained above  shaped adjustment in activity   shap e has two parts  as in stagflation regarding the second bit there is nothing that guarantees a n interest rate cut after the vertical drop stagnation especially when paired with inflation stagflation  means that interest rates may be kept high for a while to ensure that rate cuts  which might trigger a renewed bout that would suggest that the fed wants to avoid a recession there will be pain or that the fed would rush to cut rates if we had a recession with high inflation  easingly stochastic world and forecast s can change with incoming geopolitical events and the next step after the fed ending a running commentary of hikes too much forward guidance may be ending the practice of publishing the sep and the dot plots  were that time to think outside the box and to appreciate the pattern  the fed went from transitory to not transitory no hikes to hikes hikes to a string of rate hikes a string of 25 bps to a string of 50 bps a string of 50 bps to a string of 75 bps a string of 75 bps with forward guidance to the same without any comments bill dudl ey and larry summers are having a volcker moment in a spot sense but they are not in charge 
 1 august 2022 war and interest rates 9 of interest rate hikes jay powell has too and that is why he is moving slower but moving he is and he is quietly having his volcker moment in a rolling forward sense look at the pattern above listen to him when he says that there will be pain listen to him when he cut when inflation is dead we are paraphrasing powell only on the last bit but are n o t exaggerating this is not the growth  sensitive fed of the post  gfc era this is not the stocks  sensitive fed of the post  greenspan era this is not this is a di if you think that the peak of tightening is 35 because inflation peaked recession is nigh and stocks are now at the cusp of a bear market maybe not becaus e we need a recession and lower asset prices are the path to a recession  you might be terribly wrong bill dudley and larry summers are right about the make no mistake about it the risk of the fed hiking to 5 or 6 is very real  and ditto the risk of rates cresting there despite economic and asset price pain  the market and th e sep perhaps the market because of the sep  is telling us that we will curb the biggest outbreak of inflation in fifty years with a hiking cycle negative real interest rates unless you think that inflation moderates to target that is 2 by next year if that is true i am going to re  take economics 101 what could i be missing is jay powell a dark horse who is more political than serious about inflation i do not think so  avoid mak i ng good on that promise  if you do you damage the fed reputation irreparably  t he risks are such that powell will try his very best to curb inflation  even at the cost of a and between a a deep recession is the lesser of two evils the former is public service and the latter is public di and the latter is a life  long burden whether jay powell will succeed in slaying inflation is not the question  in the context of economic war we can doubt that rather the question is whether he ll try his best to slay it there i have no doubt s  in our next dispatch start thinking about what next  i f we are right about the nature of inflation and the need for  shaped path for the economy  how will we ever ramp without generating inflation if the east holds the key to the supply side and economic war means that the supply side is held back the west will have to the current hiking cycle is not a cycle but a tightening campaign that recovery cuts but by fiscally funded industrial policy discuss in detail i n our next dispatch
