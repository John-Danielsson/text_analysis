 29 december 2022 war and currency statecraft 4 president obama called me ing a new currency  s  dollar my point is that next year and beyond the us dollar and treasury securities will likely be dealing with issues they never had to deal with before less demand not more  more competition not less  de  i am currently reading chapter 9 money and empire  and as perry notes kindleberger understood war to be a doula to financial innovation war is a hothouse and places in trade and finance and drives the fashioning of new war cuts new channels for the record perry and i totally disagree about the future of the us dollar here quote of kindleberger above bricspansion  and all that i wrote about above i help but disagree even more strongly with perry on the future of the dollar i wonder what cbdcs to our discussion  which are growing like kudzu the nature conservanc y warns t kudzu looks innocent but the invasive  mile  a  minute plant easily overtake s abandoned homes and telephone poles sanctioned countries and all of opec see here   and with the swap line network and notice  according to an interactive map published by the council of foreign relations see the map at the bottom of the page here   developed economy swap lines are basically there to provide unlimited backstop cross  border portfolio hedges and developed economy to emerging market swap lines are limit ed and temporary and serve to backstop neighbors mexico financial centers singapore  and countries with us troops south korea swap lines on the other hand   that is all of europe all of eurasia  big chunks of africa and  as per the china  gcc summit the middle east is next see here  brzezinski and kindleberger would be very upset kindleberger especially since the pboc seems to be working hard on becoming an international lender of last resort that is geographically far more diverse than the federal reserve  and not only that but an international lender of last resort that  through renminbi swap lines  aims to foster trade and real economic activity  not portfolio hedges to decades of accumulated trade surpluses for the fed the swap lines are about backstopping the past past surpluses for the pboc the swap lines are about underwriting the future  lend  lea se  now back to cbdcs and the last time i saw a reference to kudzu was during the great financial crisis when a journalist referred to aaa cdos growing like kudzu back then private aaa debt crowded out public aaa debt  which nearly killed the banking system  today  cbdcs are interweaving brics central banks to replicat e the global correspondent banking system that the us dollar system runs on  supremacy  as the dollar became weaponized m omentum for cbd cs sped up china obviously has one india has one too brazil and russia w ill launch one by 2024 and south africa is a bit behind but recognizes the value of having one  and one might assume it wi ll get fast  track help from fellow members of the brics club  furthermore 
 29 december 2022 war and currency statecraft 5 among the aspiring brics members the uae already has one and under proje ct aber  the uae and saudi arabia are exploring a single dual  issued digital currency for domestic and cross  border settlement between their countries i am certain neom will use that digital currency too  and maybe all of the gcc will adopt is as its digital currency as well  i f the uae and saudi arabia are working on a dual  issued cbdc that cbdc will likely be in the cards for the entire gcc renminbi settlement of oil and gas in new paradigm here and here  and you can see how and an e  petroyuan threaten the petrodollar reference to the m  cbdc bridge project that the bis calls project mbridge see here  words may have been mi xed up  but the two projects are definitely the same   which r ecreates the correspondent banking system from scratch by interlinking central banks through cbdcs the fed should be most careful with cbdcs  the might of the dollar runs through the global hierarchical network of g  sibs and correspondent banks that the swap lines were built to support during stress  the last thing we need is the fed to hasten the demise of that hierarchy with the launch of its own cbdc  as gover n ments propose markets dispose  and if kindleberger ran the fed eral reserve today i think he advocate for the preserv ation of the network of private banks and private d ealers that have been spread ing the dollar globally like kudzu since the end of w w that t he global east and south are going the cbdc route because the us dollar was weaponized through the weaponiz ation of the network of balance sheets that enables the dollar system  like the army and navy are the arms of the state the g7 central banks banks  and dealers all g  sibs that took part in freezing ecame the instruments of weaponizing the us dollar hence arms of the state in what we can bravely call a total financial war  naturally those who believe to be at risk of being sanctioned by the us are trying to build something from scratch not with the fed atop but the pboc not fedwire  chips  and swift as separate systems but cips as one system  not a network of g7 g  sib banks but a network of brics central banks and not referencing the dollar in all fx transactions but linking end  points direc tly that is why should someone in hungary who has to pay someone in singapore go through a chain of transactions and intermediaries that involve selling huf for eur eur for usd  and usd for sgd when cbdcs allow the sale of huf for sgd directly with a network of central banks via cbdcs is revolutionary  project mbridge is just the beginning but it tells us the shape of things to come for the fed reiterate  cbdcs are a n existential threat  d hasten the downtrend of the use of the dollar by dismantling the hierarchy through the launch of a regulated liability network  cbdcs fix the crypto problem so do n o t do cbdcs just to tame the fallout from ftx and all that the crypto crowd wants not something digital per se  but something the fed won  again be printed soon bricspansion and de  dollarization trends above  m ore qe is a  t here are many big problems ahead  we have a regulated liability network already called the bloody banking system 
 29 december 2022 war and currency statecraft 6 in a total financial war  central banks of the collective west should not fall into the trap of cbdc  envy  i f the state department is working on pulling the g7 closer together and the pentagon is pulling nato closer together the last thing the federal reserve should do is to tear the network apart the network of private balance sheets that dollar system runs on with a cbdc  we have a digital system already i am fine holding a checking account at a bank and i function perfectly fine wi th a copy of my credit card on amazon and my bank account on venmo to buy the stuff i need  to emphasize crypto is about the distaste for qe not an appetite for digital cash per se  and t he regulated liability network of the fed offers digital cash not un  printable money now b ack to the opening question  what is a g7 rates strategist yours truly to do when geopolitic al t re nds are set to shape dollar funding and rates markets  and a total financial war and a total war for commodities that is the encumbrance of commodities see here  has been and will remain a driver of price action as perry channels kindleberger  war cuts new channels  and as i have warned about at length above this year appear to have accelerated the pace of cutting new channels to better serve better serve your investors you should adapt too starting next year my money dispatches will fall into three distinct categories first similar to my essays since the outbreak of the war in ukraine this year  i will be writing some long thematic dispatches that will explore geopolitics commodities  and inflation and eventually define what bretton woods iii means second returning to past habits i will resume writing global money dispatches  which will continue to explore money market s  g  sibs and balance sheet trends  but i ll resume these dispatches keeping in mind that over the next five years  the way th ancien rgime montaire will trade will be heavily influenced by the rollout of a cbdc  based monetary system and de  dollarization in the east i think this period will be similar to the rollout of basel iii  which also changed the way funding markets trade d and served up a few curveballs along the way  third i ll launch a new series of dispatch es  the bretton woods iii dispatch es  a series that will track financial order once again what regulators did to rates markets via the rollout of basel iii brics heads of state will repeat with bricspansion  de  dollari zation  and but t he process  and even with basel iii despite full transparency we always do our homework  which led to system  wide constraints bottlenecks  and basis blowups at times still basel iii was friendly currency statecraft  cbdcs will be importantly the new dispatches will come with new monitors to track the evolution of bretton woods iii through prices and quantities i realize that none of my pieces this year had charts i the i think i now have a good idea of what the future look s like so m onitors are coming next the world is splitting in two  s o is the monetary system  t he dollar is at a crossroads when i think of the dollar i think of jean  claud v voiceover during his see here  preserving the s  l ike speedbumps for v an damme  brics mean pain for jean  claude v an dollar  have a happy and healthy 2023
