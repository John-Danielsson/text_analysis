 credit suisse economics war and commodity encumbrance war encumbers commodities  a recurring theme in my dispatches this year has been that in a moment when the world is goin g from unipolar to multipolar the actions of heads of state are far more important than the actions of central banks that i s because heads of state lead their actions a ffe ct inflation  and central banks merely follow by hiking rates to  c entral banks will be behind the curve in this game  and if investor s read only the speeches of central bankers but not statesmen  they w ill be even more behind the curve the multipolar world order is being built not by g7 heads of state but by t he g 7 of the east  the brics heads of state   which is a g5 really but because of brics pansion  i took the liberty to round up  the special relationship between china and russia has a financial agenda to it and what president xi and president putin say about the future of money that is the future they envision matters for the future of the us dollar and liquidity in the us treasury market their actions are forging something new  bretton woods iii is slowly taking shape  and in light of developments to date  my motto for bretton woods iii our commodity your problem remains apt president visit with saudi and gcc leaders marks the birth of the petroyuan and a leap in growing encumbrance of oil and gas r eserves  with the china  gcc summit china can claim to have built a relationship not only with the sign in opec russia  but with iran and all of opec was the very first china  arab states summit in history and aboard an american cruiser the uss quincy fixed income investors should care but also because com modity encumbrance mean s more inflation for the west  here are the key parts speech at the china  gcc summit all emphasis with orange underlines are mine  in the next three to five years  china is ready to work with gcc countries in the followi ng priority areas f irst setting up a new paradigm of all  dimensional energy cooperation  where c hina will continue to import large quantities of crude oil on a long  term basis from gcc countries and purchase more lng we will strengthen our cooperation in the upstream sector engineering services as well as downstream storage transportation  and refiner y  the shanghai petroleum and natural gas exchange platform will be fully utilized for rmb settlement in oil and gas trade  and we could start currency swap cooperation and advance the m  cbdc bridge project  27 december 2022 investment solutions  sustainability global important information this is not research please refer to the important disclosures and contact your credit suisse representative for more details this report represents the views of the investment strategy department of credit suisse and has not been prepared in accordance with the legal requirements designed to promote the independence of investment research it is not a product of the credit suisse research department and the view of the investment strategy department may differ materially from the views of the credit suis se research department and other divisions at credit suisse even if it references published research recommendations credit suisse has a number of policies in place to promote the independence of credit suisse s research departments from credit suisse s investment strategy  and other departments and to manage conflicts of interest including policies relating to dealing ahead of the dissemination of investment research  these policies do not apply to the views of investment strategists contained in this re port contributors zoltan pozsar 212 538 3779 zoltanpozsarcredit  suissecom 
 27 december 2022 war and commodity encumbrance 2 color them with other pieces of information as we go along first what is the of this theme  the next three to five years  i n market terms that means that five  year forward five  year inflation breakevens should be discounting a world in which oil and gas is invoiced not only in dollars but also renminbi and in which some oil and gas is not available for the west at low prices and in dollars because they have been encumbered by the east but i t does not appear that breakeven expectations ref lect anything like that my sense is that the market is starting to realize that the world is going from unipolar to multipolar politically  but the market ha s yet to make the leap that in the emerging m ultipolar world order  cross  currency bases will be smaller commodity bases will be greater and inflation rates in the west will be higher i nflation traders should be paranoid not complacent as andy grove said only the paranoid survive  but when i asked a small group of inflation traders ov er dinner in london this summer about how the market they come s up with five  year forward five  year breakevens  i did not sense any degree of paranoia there is no top  down or bottom  up work that we do to come up with our estimates we t the rest is liquidity i nflation breakevens do n o t seem to price any geopoliti cal risk  paradigm a new paradigm of all  dimensional energy cooperation is a symbolic word  the meeting between fdr and king abdul aziz ibn saud was a new paradigm too  security guarantees for the kingdom for access to affordable oil supplies over time the paradigm boiled down to this the us import ed oil and pa id for it with u s dollars  which saudi arabia spen t on treasuries and arms and recycle d the leftovers as deposits in us bank s   i n the wake of the opec shocks of the 1970s that recycling of petrodollar s led to the latin american debt crisis in the 1980s   the old paradigm until it d id  the us is now less reliant on oil from the middle east owing to the shale revolution while china is the lar gest importer of oil security relations are in flux see here  saudi holdings of us treasuries and bank deposits are down as the k ingdom went from funding the us government and banks to owning equity in firms  and the saudi c rown p rince said recently that the k ingdom could reduce its investments in the us see here  similar pattern s hold in other gcc countries the new paradigm between china  saudi arabia  and gcc countries is fundamentally different from the one struck aboard uss quincy naturally so as china is now dealing with a rich middle east whereas fdr was dealing with a middle east that had just started to develop wi th wealth power and priorities shift back then  liquidity and security were more important for an emerging region  today  equity and respect are more important for what has bec o me an eminent region  that is what china offered all  dim ensional energy cooperation means not just taking oil for cash and arms but investing in the region downstream sector and leveraging the regional know  how for cooperation in the upstream sector upstream could potentially mean the joint exploration of oil in the south china sea  all  dimensional energy cooperation also means working in cooperation on the localized production of new energy equipment see here   put differ ently  oil for development plants and jobs oil for arms the belt and road initiative me t vision 2030 in a big win  win 
 27 december 2022 war and commodity encumbrance 3 third new paradigm will not be fund ed with us dollars  president xi noted that he shanghai petroleum and natural gas exchange will be fully utilized for rmb settlement in oil and gas trade president c hina will continue to import large quantities of crude oil on a long  term basis from gcc countries and purchase more lng underscores the gravity of the underlined quote  c ombined the two basically say tha t china already the lar gest buyer of oil and gas from gcc countries  will buy even more in the future and wants to pay for all of it in renminbi over the next three to five years again think of the timing of th is statement in a diplomatic sense president xi his visit when he met only the saudi leadership but during the second day of his visit when he met the leadership of all the gc c countries to in part signal gcc oil flowing east  renminbi invoicing  the dawn of the petroyuan  good morning given the scope of priority areas in which china plans to work with gcc countries the sale of clean energy infrastructure  big data and cloud computing centers 5 g and 6g projects and cooperation in smart manufacturing and space exploration speech there will be many avenues through which gcc countries will be able to decumulate the renminbi they earn from selling oil and gas to china and if  perish the thought  any gcc country were to accumulate some surplus cash in non  convertible renminbi just as president plane was landing in riyadh the pboc revealed that during 2022 it had re  started gold purchases with gusto  why do china gold purchases m atter in the context of renminbi settlement because at the 2018 brics summit china launched a renminbi  denominated oil futures contract on the shanghai international energy exchange and since 2016 and 2017 the renminbi has been convertible to gold on the shanghai p araphrasing forrest gump you can spend it on solar panels wind turbines data centers telecommunications equipment  or space projects to create jobs or you can just recycle it at some bank or just convert it to good old gold bars money is as money does and convertibility to gold beats convertibility to dollars  president three  to five  year horizon means that by 2025 the gcc may be paid in renminbi for all of the oil and gas that they will be s hipp ing e ast to china  when was the last time you heard a head of state talk about swap lines and central bank digital currencies cbdc and n ot just any cbdc but a specific one  the m  cbdc bridge project see here  the m  cbdc bridge project  or as the bis likes to refer to it project mbr idge  is a masterclass in plumbing undertaken by the pboc  the bank of thailand the hkma  and the central bank of the united arab emirates  the project enables real  time peer  to  peer cross  border  and foreign exchange transactions using cbdcs  and do es so without involving the us dollar or the network of western correspondent banks that the us dollar system runs on  pretty interesting no in a very uncle sam  like fashion see here  china wants more of the oil wants to pay for it with renminbi  and wants the gcc to accept e  renminbi on the m  cbdc bridge platform  so hesitate join the m bridge fast train 
 27 december 2022 war and commodity encumbrance 4 and finally currency swap cooperation  reminded me of using swap lines as analogue s of the lend  lease agreement whereby the us lent dollars to britain to buy arms to fight germany during wwii  now we fight climate change and if you don t earn renminbi to build neom  no problem at all we can swap your local currency for my local currency whereby i lend you some renminbi and then you can buy the stuff you need  and when you will start selling me oil for renminbi  you can pay off the swap lines all i care about is that you don t pay for imports from me in us dollars  because i have enough us dollars already and i don t want to add to my sanctions risk  the m  cbdc bridge project offers further leads down the monetary rabbit hole i understand when i first read about russia requesting oil payments from india in united arab emirates dirhams but now i do  dirham russia because the central bank of the u ae is a member of m  cbdc bridge and so dirhams can be sold for renminbi using central bank digital currencies and thus away from the western banking system this does not necessarily have to go through the m  cbdc bridge p roject per se  but the existence of it i m plies that some cbdcs are already interlinked to facilitate interstate payments the western system then perhaps inspired by  on december 6 th  bloomberg ran a story about india and the uae working on a rupee  dirham payment mechanism to bypass the us dollar in bilateral trade  a mechanism that will include payments for oil and gas purchases from the uae d o take a step back and consider that since the beginning of this year  2022  russia has been selling oil to china for renminbi  and to india for uae dirhams india and the uae are working on settling oil and gas trades in dirhams by 2023 and china is ask ing the gcc to fully utilize exchanges to settle a ll oil and gas sales to china in renminbi by 2025 dusk for the petrodollar dawn for the petroyuan  now on to the topic of commodity encumbrance  of transactions involving collateral if collateral is pledged to a specific trade referred to as  which means it be used to do other trades if encumbrance becomes extreme collateral gets scarce  which typically shows up as interest rates on scarce pieces of collateral trading deep ly below ois rates under bretton woods iii a system in which commodities are collateral encumbrance means that commodities can get scarce in certain parts of the world and that scarcity shows up as inflation printing far above inflation targets to see w h at e ncumbrance means in the context of the oil and gas markets today  l  opec plus russia  t he original founding members o f opec were the islamic republic of iran iraq saudi arabia  kuwait  and venezuela in 1960 which were later joined by qatar 1961 indonesia 1962 libya 1962 the united arab emirates 1967 algeria 1969 nigeria 1971 ecuador 1973 gabon 1975 angola 2007 equatorial guinea 2017  and congo 2018 russia joined opec in 2016 a union that forged opec  think of opec as follows russia iran the gcc  latin american producers north african producers west african producers and indonesia i left out iraq where isis is complicating the overall picture but the rest of the groupings show how china is starting to dominate opec first  russia and china have their famous special relationship  and since the outbreak of hostiliti es in ukraine china has been paying for russian oil in renminbi at a steep discount  as president putin remarked  china drives a hard bargain 
 27 december 2022 war and commodity encumbrance 5 second i ran and china have also had a special relationship since march 27 2021 the comprehensive strategic partnership a 25  year deal under which steady supply of iran ian oil at a steep discount  the deal included 280 billion toward developing downstream petrochemical sectors refining and plastics specifically  under the agreement  china will be able to buy any and all iranian oil gas  and petrochemical products at a minimum guaranteed discount of 12 percent to the six  month rolling mean price of comparable benchmark products  plus another 6 to 8 percent on top for risk  adjusted compensation here  t his means that iran is selling its oil to china at about the same price as russia  or maybe in reverse  as the iran deal predates the post  ukraine prices for russia  third venezuela has been accepting payments for oil in renminbi since 2019 see here  and has also been selling oil to china at steep discounts see here  fourth  gcc was similar to the comprehensive strategic partnership wit h iran investments in downstream petrochemical projects  manufacturing  and infrastructure plus some higher value  added projects for saudi arabia to aid riyadh silicon valley aspirations  because the gcc aren sanctioned  china did n t ask for any steep discounts  but it did ask for renminbi settlement   and venezuela account for about reserves  and each of them are currently selling oil to china for renminbi at a steep discount  the gcc cou ntries account for 40 percent of proven oil reserves as well saudi arabia has a half of that  and the other gcc countries the other half and are being courted by china to accept renminbi for their oil in exchange for transformative investments the new paradigm discussed above  to underscore  the us has sanctioned half of opec with 40 percent of the oil reserves and lost them to china while china is courting the other half of opec with a n offer th refuse the remaining 20 percent of proven oil reserves are in north and west africa and indonesia geopolitically north africa is dominated by russia at present see here  west africa by china  and indonesia has its own agenda see below commodity encumbrance here three to five years  china will not only pay for more oil in renminbi crowding out the us dollar but new investments in downstream petrochemical industries in iran saudi arabia  and the gcc more broadly mean that in the future much more value  added will be captured locally at the expense of industries in the west think of this  to  model  i used to sell my chicken and vegetables to you  and you sold soup for a markup in your five  star restaurant but from now on  myself get to import i t in a can my oil my jobs  your spend our commodity your problem our commodity our emancipation  c ommodity encumbrance has had its first major casualty in europe already  decision to permanently downsize its operations at its main plant in ludwigshafen and instead shift its chemical operations to china was motivated by the fact that china is secur ing energy at discounts  not markups like europe  collateral encumbrance means encumbrance from the perspective of someone pledging collateral to a dealer  d ealers in turn rehypothecate pledged collateral commodity rehypothecation will work the same way heavily discounted oil and locally produced chemicals invoiced in renminbi mean encumbrance by the east  and the marginal re  export of oil and chemicals also for renminbi to the west mean s commodit y rehypothecation for a profit  ie  a n  to  s pread 
 27 december 2022 war and commodity encumbrance 6 we are starting to see examples of commodity rehypothecation already china became a big exporter of russian lng to europe  and india a big exporter of russian oil and refined products such as diesel to europe see here and here  and invoiced not just in euros and dollars but also renminbi dirhams  and rupees but c ommodity encumbrance has a darker what i described above is a de facto state of affairs in which russia iran  and venezuela have effectively pledged their resources to the brics and belt and road  and china is courting the gcc to do the same under a new paradigm  but there is also a de jure version of the commodity encumbrance theme  and here is where a recent speech by president putin comes in on june 22 2022 at the brics business forum a wef  g7 of the president putin noted that the creation of an international reserve currency based on a basket of currencies of our countries is being worked on here  this china failed to reform the sdr a nd its antecedents were chronicled in a recent book by zoe liu and mihaela papa can the brics de  dollarize the global financial system see here   the book was funded by the rising power alliances project at the fletcher school of tufts university  which in turn was funded by the us department of defense it would seem to me that if the dod has a keen interest in the topic of de  dollarization market participants should have one as well  and should also add commodity encumbrance to the list  brics coin w hen a g7 rates strategist or trader starts looking at the g7 of the east  he or she wi ll realize that institutions and people are different but they do exist  r egarding the development of an international reserve currency  la the sdr sergei glazyev has been in charge  s ince 2019  glazyev has been serving as m inister in charge of integration and macroeconomics of the eec that is the eurasian economic commission  he strikes me as someone similar to liu he  who president xi introduced to a former us national secur ity advisor saying this is liu he he is very important to me  g iven his recent progress report on cs  sergei glazyev seems to be very important to president putin  regarding institutionalized commodity encumbrance  the comments i could find project from glazyev revolve around the methodology to determine the weight of each participating currency in the  specifically  should a nation  reserve a portion of its natural resources for the backing of the new economic system its respective weight in the currency basket of the new monetary unit would increase accordingly providing that nation with larger currency reserves and credit c apacity  in addition bilateral swap lines with trading partner countries would provide them with adequate financing for co  investments and trade financing see here   hm swap lines again to facilitate trade and investments and a de jure vision for commodity encumbrance in exchange for boosting a credit line in an alternative economic system  i t seems to me that new paradigms come in pairs a ttention needs to be paid to the goings  on of the global east and south  especially given that this year saudi arabia turkey  and iran have all started their application to the brics see here   furthermore following shanghai cooperation organization  sco  s ummit in samarkand the sco grant ed dialogue partner status saudi arabia and qatar and start ed procedures to admit iran as a member 
 27 dec ember 2022 war and commodity encumbrance 7 in riyadh president xi referred to a garden of civilizations in the context of the belt and road initiative see here  unless they involve adam eve  and a snake gardens typically refer to a happy and peaceful place now consider that if russia and iran get along china and iran get along russia and saudi arabia get along  and china and saudi arabia get along then the foreign ministers of saudi arabia and iran engaging in what the ft called friendly talks last week see here  means more momentum for belt and road brics  and  indeed for the belt and road initiative to work the region has to be a peaceful garden of civilizations  and f or the enemy of my enemy is my fr iend to work a g reat p ower needs to befriend the enemy of a rival g reat p ower  but that strategy is increasingly hard to implement in the middle eastern of the belt and road initiative bri  the great powers of the eurasian landmass china and russia  and each of them have good a relationship with each of the great powers of the middle east  a nd all of them have much to gain from building a new economic and monetary system the china  gcc summit is one thing  and strategic partnership with iran is another but both saudi arabia and iran applying to pillar institutions of the multipolar world order brics and the sco at t he same exact time plus  weighted neutral reserve asset that encourages members to pledg e their commodities to the  should have g7 bond investors concerned  b ecause these trends may keep inflation from slowing and interest rates from falling for the rest of this decade finally the de facto and de jure commodity encumbrance themes described above have an even graver inflationary undertone if you consider the following over the past decade  all growth in global oil production came from us shale and other non  conventional sources such as canadian tar sands we know the kingdom is currently pumping at capa city and will be able to boost output by only one million barrels per day by 2025 and then no more  in light of that consider that production from shale fields has peaked and recall some recent comments from the lar gest shale operator in the us that more drilling would harm the shale industry see here  it appears to me that unless the us nationalizes shale oil fields and starts to drill for oil itself to boost production over the next three to five years  lookin g at a n inelastic supply of oil and gas inelastic supply  1 china will get a bigger share at a discount  invoiced in renminbi  2 china will export more downstream products at a wider margin 3 china will lure more firms like basf with discounted energy bills  4 iran with chinese capital will do more downstream exports too and 5 gcc countries  with chinese capital ditto  most likely for renminbi  new paradigm  as i see it  comes with a emancipation both sanctioned and non  sanctioned members of opec with chinese capital  to  in which they will not just sell oil but will also refine more of it and process more of it into high value  added petrochemical products given supply constraints over the next three to five years  this will likely be at the expense of refiners and petrochemical firms in the west  and also growth in the west  a ll this means much less domestic production and more inflation as steadily price  inflating alternatives are imported from the east
