 24 august 2022 war and industrial policy 2 how did we lose trust and then wanted to build 5g networks globally and make cutting  edge chips with cutting  edge lithography machines but the us said way as a result chimerica is going through a messy divorce  t taiwan crisis see here  russia got very rich selling cheap gas to europe and germany got very rich selling expensive stuff produced with cheap gas current ac counts swelled for both  business was so good that russia and germany planned a vow renewal with nord stream 2 but the ceremony was called off abruptly and turned into divorce  as one side did something the other tolerate  events unfolded quickly and involve d nato ukraine  and the balance of power in continental europe and the result is another messy divorce in which inconceivable see here  finally the us got very rich by doing qe but the license for qe came from the regime enabled by cheap exports coming from russia and china naturally the top of the global economic food chain the us the lowflation regime to end but if chimerica and eurussia are over as unions the lowflation regime will have to end period as we noted in our pr ior dispatch  the special relationship between china and russia is a powerful one a marriage of commodities and industry  uniting the largest commodity producer russia and the factory of the world china potentially in control of one disenfranchised spouse china from the chimerica union found another russia from the eurussia union  to form a n economic union out of revenge  one gets commodities it does not have and the other chips and other stuff it can no longer get from the west owing to western sanctions the other two spouses are getting together too to form a union but this one is more like a  in which one gravely needs the other for economic sec u rity  wars like the currently unf olding economic war  are about control the control of technologies chips commodities gas   production zero  covid  and straits chokepoints like the taiwan strait the strait of hormuz  or the bosporus strait wars are also about alliances the one ha nd and russia and china on the other the world is best described by the enemy of my enemy is my friend russia and china hold naval exercises with iran around the strait of hormuz iran has recently hosted talks between russia and turkey regarding grain shipments through the bosporus strait  not surprisingly the first shipment sail ed to the syria n port of tartus  which hosts a technical support point not a base of the russian navy  even more recently turkey and russia agree d to clear bilateral trade flows including gas in rubles  in this com plex web of geo  strategic hotspots around the eurasian landmass  the noose is tightening for friends of my enemy  taiwan was effectiv ely subject to a weeklong sea and air blockade recently  and south korea is being three nos  the essence of which is to end all forms of military cooperation with the us while at the same time north ko brink of war t he checkmate  like position that s eoul finds it self in is so hard to navigate that president yoon meet speaker pelosi on her stop in south korea and opted for theater instead  more on this below  
 24 august 2022 war and industrial policy 3 our commodities your problem is branching into chips from our backyard your problem might also branch into our strait s  your proble m the us threatening turkey with secondary sanctions for financial cooperation with russia should be understood in light of the inconvenient geographic fact that access to the black sea goes through bosporus strait  th at makes the threat of sanctions only that a threat  or a  if i step back  i see a fierce geo  strategic game of chess in progress on the eurasian landmass  forget the brics ocus instead on turkey russia iran  china  and north korea play ing ric ks on the eurasian landmass a n alliance of economies sanctioned by the us getting ever closer economically and militarily  this eurasian alliance of the sanctioned is forcing the friends of the us to play pragmatically for example despite pressure from the us india decided to increase its imports from russia and participate in vostok  2022 military exercises  and the  to china sea and air blockade of taiwan puts south korea in a very difficult situation given the fact that the us decided to not include south korea in the aukus defense pact  a s pippa malmgren has recently noted  the feeling in washington  dc is that south korea chose strategic ambiguity eoul is no longer e north i f the two koreas are reconciled  there is no need for the us to station 30000 troops to protect south korea and that may well explain why president yoon speaker pelosi  you are wrong read history or grow up in hungary i was eleven years old when on june 16 th  1989  a young viktor orban dem anded that soviet troops withdraw from hungary that was just months before the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 th birth of the regime  moment in south korean foreign policy  could south korea  f eeling the heat of the checkmate that it is in  demand that us troops withdraw from its country  similar to how  that south korea making chips is different from this south korea making chips  c hips may thus be at risk not only in taiwan but also in south korea  but all makes the us choice between supporting the hungarian revolution against the soviet union or egypt against israel britain  and france in 1956 a geo  1956 hold one important lesson for the markets today which is that the unit s of wars are battles sometimes even g reat powers choose their battles battles on multiple fronts ukraine taiwan  and the question of south korea mean that priorities can change in 1956 oil was more important than hungary which is why i grew up on the eastern side of the berlin wall watching movies about what life wa s like on the western side of the berlin wall today living in manhattan the capital of western civilization i am watching the east in action a nd wonder whether the us will manage to maintain the existing world order or like in 1956 chips  or oil or worse could the tricks c heckmate the us on the eurasian chessboard  
 24 august 2022 war and industrial policy 4 i have no idea neither do you and neither does the pentagon see here  nd why forecast s of a rapid deceleration of inflation are naively optimistic  i f pax americana enabled globalization and globalization underwrote lowflation the tricks trying to poke holes in the pax means that inflation is a big risk to understand the path of inflation from here we will have to read more history and think about trust trade  and theory of trade expectations if trust drove globalization  a distrust will drive de  globalization and de  the great reflation what will be the economic consequences of mistrust   we will articulate our vision for what a peaceful transition   la post  soviet globalization to a new world order may look like we ll pick up where our last dispatch  shaped recession to slow inflation down we had to generate a round of negative wealth effects to lower demand such that it becomes more in  line with the new realities of supply  inflation did slow but it s still above target as dealing with the costs of the split of chimerica and eurussia  these costs policy rates because the ramp  up in demand hits supply cons t raints immediately inflation seems ever present almost persistent  what do we have to do is unlikely to  as will have to produce stuff on our own  will come from investments  with help from the government consider three first  how do you wage wars on multiple fronts when a single front in ukraine showed how quickly stockpiles can deplete in a war of attrition and how slow the replacement i s see here  this is not about high  tech weapons that need chips but rather basic artillery as a recent ft article fetishes for high  tech weapons and lean manufacturing have obscured the importance of maintaining stockpiles of basic kits like artillery shells total annual us production of 155 million artillery shells for example would last only about two weeks in ukraine a conflict that marks the return of industrial warfare the west needs to be more disciplined not always to seek the exquisite but rather to understand how the exquisite allows what is quite boring and banal second  not like the exquisite stuff can be made quickly either in may when washington ordered 1300 st inger anti  aircraft missiles to replace those sent to ukraine the chief executive of raytheon replied it will take us a little while see here  and this is not just a replacement issue the delivery of st ingers to taiwan has been delayed recently to enable the flood of weapons to ukraine see here  and saudi arabia also fac es delay s as it aims to re  stock its arsenal see here  meanwhile on a recent earnings call peter wennick the ceo of asml the m aker of cutting  edge lithography machines  noted the following i met the executive of a very large industrial company a conglomerate last week and he to chips to put them into industrial modules i mean  third the message from temporary blockade of taiwan was clear chips are useful when they can be shipped not when stuck due to a blockade  h ow can the us c ontrol its lowflation qe  based economic destiny when the emergence of a multipolar world order is fracturing global supply chains which frustrates its ability to obtain chips for missiles to defend the existing world order  
 24 august 2022 war and industrial policy 5 say the east is having it easy  russia is having military issues too  and sanctions have limited its access to western technologies like chips  b ut we also know that the relationship between russia and china has no limits see here   and also that china makes chips smi c  chips are like soft drinks  coca  cola and pepsi are both fizzy drinks made to quench your thirst  and similarly most chips are chips whether they were made by tsmc or smic  and russian missiles can fly perfectly fine with either of them  like energy flows chip flows were also re  drawn by the war r e  drawn  not blocked or eliminated  russian piped natural gas was replaced with us lng for continental europe taiwanese south korean  and japanese chips with chinese chips for russia  life i see unfolding on the eurasian chessboard most of the tail risks i see are pointed at the west and western inflation forecasts  c chips from our backyard your problem more broadly the three of reckoning we discussed above mean that g lobal supply chains whether they produce military or civilian goods are facing a minsky moment a real minsky moment  paul mcculley s term referred to the implosion of the long  intermediation chains of the shadow banking system that marked the onset of the great financial crisis today we are witnessing the implosion of the long  intermediation chains of the globaliz ed world order  mask s baby formula chips missiles  and artillery shells  for now  the triggers a lack of liquidity and capital in the banking and shadow banking systems but a lack of inventory and protection in the globalized production system in which we design at home and manage from home but source produce  and ship everything from abroad where commodities factories  and fleets of ships are dominated by states russia and china that are in conflict with the west  inventory for supply chains is what liquidity is for banks in 2007  08 big banks ran on just  in  for which you could always sell assets into a deep market without moving prices  so you did not have to have liquidity reserves at the central bank similarly  in  for which they assume that they can always source what they need without moving the price but not really will take a little while taiwan and saudi arabia have to wait as well until the conflict in ukraine is over and if your washing m defense contractors are done buying them up to rip chips out to make missiles do you r emember the three units of minsky hedge units can cover their payments from their incomes speculative units have to borrow to be able to make payments and ponzi units can make their payments only if they sell some of their assets and are thus the most exposed to rising interest rates as our chip e xamples demonstrate minsky would classify our military supply chain s  which are exposed to a further escalation of geopolitical tensions that could ea sily turn them into ponzi supply chains we can also apply framework in europe where german y can t cover its payments without russian gas and the government is asking citizens to conserve energy to leave more fo r industry  minsky moments are triggered by excessive financial leverage  and i n the context of supply chains leverage means excessive operating leverage in germany 2 trillion of value added depends on 20 billion of gas from russia 
 24 august 2022 war and indus trial policy 6 100  times leverage see the last chart here  and t he concept of operating leverage applies in the military domain too if taiwan makes the chips for the missiles the us sends it for self  defense but has to wait for missiles because they are needed in ukraine instead or owing to a sea and air blockade imposed by china  the us is operationally ill  equipped to support a two  front war  and lowflation protection by pax americana for global supply chains is what capital is for banks in 2007  08 big banks didn t have enough capital to deal with systemic events  because they were too big to fail  t he assumption was that the state will bail them out the s tate did provide a bail out but at a cost which was basel iii today the assumption among investors to maintain order t he systemic event is someone challenging the hegemon  and today russia and china are challenging the us hegemon  for the current world order and its trade arrangements and network of global supply chains to survive the challenge the challenge must be squashed quickly and decisively in the spirit of the powell doctrine but ukraine and taiwan aren t kuwait  russia and china aren t iraq  a nd top gun 2 is the same movie as top gun think about what tim geithner said about how to deal with crises like the asian financial crisis or a herd of short sellers questioning the solvency of the us banking system see here and below in context russia and china are basically the  led world order and according to approach we should be using overwhelming force not piecemeal the vietnam approach what we thought was overwhelming force to the liabilities that could run w hat general powell w as to desert storm secretary geithner was to re  establishing trust i n the us banking system posture of secretary gina raimondo regarding the state of supply chains a lot of money in the window vulnerabilities in the window as secretary raimondo recently noted the us buys 70 of its most sophisticated chips from taiwan those are the chips in j avelin launching system congress pass chips and the us to secure our future  hank paulson moment who begged congress on his knees to get tarp funded  war makes you do surveys to survey what you you need to know your capacity to produce to know your ca pacity to fight and why simon kuznets was tasked by the commerce department in 1942 to develop the us national accounts to gauge the capacity to fight wwii  today without the survey of the global chip industry secretary raimondo c ongress have passed the 52 billion chips act as fast as it did but the hard work still lies ahead as it semiconductor sovereignty  b ut we need to put money in the window and show overwhelming force today not tomorrow today overwheleming force is on display in the taiwan
