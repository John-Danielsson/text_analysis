Chatbot: This article discusses the current economic war between the U.S., China, and Russia and how it is impacting inflation. It explains how the U.S. is using diplomacy to extract more for less, while Russia and China are engaging in a "general mobilization" of industry and resources. It also looks at how central banks are now fighting inflation with asset price deflation, and how the economic war is changing the global balance of power in the military, technology, and production domains. Furthermore, it examines how macro investing is changing in this new era of economic war, with investors like George Soros, Stanley Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones, and Louis Bacon trading in a peaceful world, punctuated only by relatively small military conflicts. It also looks at how the big conflicts these investors traded were all “nominal conflicts”, and involved markets and central banks, and the first three of the four prices of money: par, interest, and foreign exchange. Finally, it looks at how today’s conflict, a complex economic war between “empires”, drives the fourth price of money: the price level and its derivative – inflation, and how central banks are not fighting markets, but are “cleaning up”

**You:** What does Zoltan say about investing?

**Chatbot:** Zoltan cautions against relying too heavily on the SEP and dot plots when making investment decisions. He emphasizes the importance of thinking outside the box and understanding the pattern of the Fed's actions. He also warns that the risk of the Fed hiking interest rates to 5% or 6% is very real, and that the market may not be expecting a recession and lower asset prices. He advises investors to consult with their financial advisers before making any investment decisions and to be aware of the potential risks and rewards of any transaction. Additionally, he stresses the importance of understanding the different regulations and laws that may apply to investments in different jurisdictions, and to consult with a financial adviser in the relevant jurisdiction before making any investment decisions.

**You:** What does Zoltan say about portfolios?

**Chatbot:** Zoltan suggests that portfolios should be 20/40/20/20, with the weights representing cash, stocks, bonds, and commodities. He also suggests that cash should be prioritized while the curve remains inverted, as it provides a nice yield, has no duration risk, and has an option value. He also suggests that commodities should include three types of gold (yellow, black, and white), as well as other commodities like copper and cobalt. He states that commodities should be chosen due to years of underinvestment, as supply has become extraordinarily tight. He also states that the U.S. dollar won't be de-throned overnight, but on the margin, de-dollarization and digitization (CBDCs) by BRICS+ central banks will reduce dollar dominance and demand for Treasuries. He suggests that the dollar's strength or weakness should be thought of in the context of the four prices of money (par, interest, FX, and the price level).

**You:** Does Zoltan say what kind of impact the current economic war between the U.S., China, and Russia may have?

**Chatbot:** Yes, Zoltan does say what kind of impact the current economic war between the U.S., China, and Russia may have. He discusses the potential for inflation to increase, the risks posed by the fracturing of global supply chains, the need for the U.S. to use "overwhelming force" to maintain its hegemonic position, the potential for the U.S. to use technology sanctions to slow China's technological progress, the potential for the U.S. to use South Korean chipmakers' plants in China as a negotiating tool, the potential for the U.S. to use other toolmakers and also non-cutting edge tools to curb China’s and SMIC’s semiconductor ambitions, and the potential for the U.S. to limit shipments of chipmaking equipment to producers of memory chips in China. He also discusses the potential for the U.S. to use these measures targeting South Korean chipmakers’ plants in China as a negotiating tool to force Seoul to re-consider its policy of “strategic ambiguity”, and the need to consider the inflationary consequences of Russia and China challenging the U.S. hegemon.

**You:** What is inflation, in economics?

**Chatbot:** In economics, inflation is an increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. It is measured as an annual percentage increase. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy. Inflation can be caused by a variety of factors, including domestic wage pressures, increases in the cost of food, energy, and goods, and a tight labor market. In order to combat inflation, central banks may raise interest rates, which can lead to a recession. In extreme cases, governments may also implement policies to encourage thriftiness and reduce consumer spending.

**You:** What is a saxophone?

**Chatbot:** A saxophone is a woodwind instrument of the family of instruments known as the reed instruments. It is made of brass and has a conical bore, a curved metal tube with a flared bell at the end. It is played with a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet. It is used in a wide variety of musical genres, including jazz, classical, and popular music.
